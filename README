fabtests
========

Fabtests provides a set of examples that uses libfabric - a high-performance fabric software library.

Building
--------

To make this directory, run:

    ./autogen.sh && ./configure && make && make install

Typically the autogen and configure steps only need be done the first
time, unless configure.ac changes.

It the libfabric install you are using is in a non-standard location, 
you may want to configure using the --with-libfabric option:

    ./autogen.sh && ./configure --with-libfabric=LIBFAB_INSTALL_DIR && make && make install
